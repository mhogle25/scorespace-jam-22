[N:???]Hey, there. I'm a private investigator. [P:0.5] The name's Fontaine. [P:0.5] Anais Fontaine. [P:0.5] Whatcha' need me for? Was snatched off the streets while I was investigating this whole Fallen thing. [P:0.5] You're an Inquisitor I assume?[R:anais1-0-0]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Only if you make me a deal. [P:0.5] I've  heard the talk, pal. [P:0.5] Meet an Inquisitor, [P:0.5] you don't see the light of day. [P:0.5] Set me free, I'll tell you all I know.[R:anais1-1-0]
[N:Anais Fontaine]End of the road, huh? [P:0.5] Alright... [P:0.5] Okay, pal... [P:0.5] About 6 months ago, some kind of event triggered. [P:0.5] Something crazy. [P:0.5] Angels started thinking differently than before. [P:0.5] Something changed about us, we changed in our cores.[R:anais1-1-1]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I couldn't tell ya', pal. [P:0.5] *She takes a sip of coffee* [P:0.5] Maybe it shouldn't even be reverted, y'know. Angels could use some character. [P:0.5] Something to think about, huh toots? [P:0.5] Good coffee by the way.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Ah, well... To test the coffee ya gotta' taste some too. [P:0.5] Shit gets away from you fast. [P:0.5] You'd be surprised the things you have to do when you're in the dirt.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You're a cookie, toots. [P:0.5] A real sweetie. [P:0.5] Even the Big Guy upstairs can't see everything. [P:0.5] That's just my theory though.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I suppose you're right, pal. [P:0.5] But maybe I'm a real piece of work. I get in the dirt, unlike you nutheads. [P:0.5] Do you even want to solve shit?[R:anais1-1-2]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Okay, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] I'll tell you. [P:0.5] The Big Guy is doing this for an experiment. We're all his little guinea pigs, running around in the mug of coffee we call life. [P:0.5] Shit, this is damn good coffee by the way.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Yeah, maybe you're right. Seems stepping out of the Big Man's line puts you in the red. [P:0.5] It ain't ideal. [P:0.5] Peoples gotta' live. [P:0.5] Ain't no room for gray in Daedalus.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]HAH, [P:0.5] you punch weaker than my son, toots. [P:0.5] Got anymore coffee?[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You ain't foolin' no one, toots. [P:0.5] Mr. Big doesn't listen to no one.[R:anais1-1-3]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I guess that's why we do it, [P:0.5] right? Sometimes you lose that. [P:0.5] Try to look into six months ago. [P:0.5] Angels haven't been the same since.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Shit's over anyways.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Yeah, [P:0.5] and I'm the coffee fairy. God, [P:0.5] the things I'd do for a mug of Joe right now.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Yeah, [P:0.5] I have, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] How about a coffee? [P:0.5] A Fallen like me could still use a drink.[R:anais1-2-0]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You know how to treat a Fontaine, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. Round about six months ago angels were given new thoughts. [P:0.5] We weren't always this interesting y'know.[R:anais1-2-1]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I do. [P:0.5] Two of 'em. One, [P:0.5] this coffee is the best mug of Joe this side of Daedalus. [P:0.5] Two, [P:0.5] we're all like grounds in the coffee pot of life, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] We get dirty. [P:0.5] We're in all shapes and sizes. [P:0.5] Me? I get a bit more dirty than others to get things done.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Whoaaa, [P:0.5] hold your horses, toots. All I'm saying is we Angels didn't think on our own too much. [P:0.5] Hell, we were hardly different people. Something to sip on. [P:0.5] Like a good coffee. [E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Yeah, I've got ideas like this coffee's got balls. [P:0.5] Big ones. [P:0.5] Somebody went behind the Big Guy's back. Gave us angels a bit more in the noggin than they counted on.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]The same thing I do every morning, toots. [P:0.5] I live.[R:anais1-2-2]
[N:Anais Fontaine]The only damn thing worth my time is a cup of coffee. [P:0.5] And that ship has already sailed, hasn't it, [P:0.5] Inquisitor?[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I do what I have to, toots. [P:0.5] What about you, Inquisitor? [P:0.5] You happy with what you've done? What do you want out of this cup of Joe called life?[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Your punches are decaffe, pal.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Sure, toots. [P:0.5] And I'm not squirming for pounds of the caffeinated good stuff every night. [P:0.5] I can smell it in the air.[R:anais1-2-3]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Yeah, I have. [P:0.5] Something in the air ain't right these days. [P:0.5] It wasn't always like this. [P:0.5] But you know that, [P:0.5] don't you, toots?[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Guess the Big Guy's crew can't even afford a cup of Joe. [P:0.5] Taste the air, toots.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Doubling down, ey' toots? [P:0.5] Maybe I've been in the ground too long, but I can't tell which one of us is muddier.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Lying doesn't suit you, toots. [P:0.5] Let's get it straight, then maybe I'll talk.[R:anais1-3-0]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I'm sure I don't know more than the Inquisition, pal. [P:0.5] What could I know that your people don't know already?[R:anais1-3-1]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You're not wrong there, toots. [P:0.5] Maybe I've heard a few things here and there. [P:0.5] All I know is nothing you haven't seen. [P:0.5] Angels are different these days. [P:0.5] What about you?[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You're not wrong, pal. Maybe I'll throw you a bone. [P:0.5] This whole Fallen thing? [P:0.5] It's recent, [P:0.5] by about six months.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You're a real piece of work, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] My lips are sealed.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Now you're talking my language, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] Some sort of event changed our lives six months ago. [P:0.5] Caused us angels to think differently.[R:anais1-3-2]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Not sure, exactly. [P:0.5] But something beyond the Big Guy's vision. [P:0.5] That's why he's so scrambled to research this. Hell, we all are. [P:0.5] *She takes a sip of coffee*.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Us angels, we're flavorful. [P:0.5] Like a nice roast. [P:0.5] But it wasn't always this way. We never stepped outta' line, never thought for ourselves. [P:0.5] Now? We can Fall. [P:0.5] Fall any which way we want.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]Have ya', toots? [P:0.5] Well thank Big Guy for that, cause you're the only one.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]And neither do I, pal. [P:0.5] Maybe pack some punch next time, like my old barrista.[R:anais1-3-3]
[N:Anais Fontaine]I'm my own angel, toots. [P:0.5] Try it sometime.[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]This city's a bitch, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] A nice roast isn't. But it seems my time is up, huh, pal?[E]
[N:Anais Fontaine]You're in for a doozy, pal. [P:0.5] You wouldn't know a latte from a cappucino if ya' snorted em up your nose.[E]
