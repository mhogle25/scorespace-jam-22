[N:Gabriel]Um, excuse me? I was asked to come here. Is there some sort of problem? I would love to help if I can, but I don’t know if there’s too much I can do. I was about to get set up with a client before they guided me here.[R:gabriel1-0-0]
[N:Gabriel]Well yeah. I often get together with people and go out for dinner and chat with them. They’re usually always civil.[R:gabriel1-1-0]
[N:Gabriel]Well sometimes we do…more. But only with the people I really like! And sometimes it’s for free if I really like them. More than anything they just give me money to help me out with bills. The last one, for instance, said that he just wanted to see me happy and wouldn’t take no for an answer![R:gabriel1-1-1]
[N:Gabriel]Prostitution? But I was just hanging out with friends! Please be reasonable, Inquisitor. We weren’t doing anything wrong and no one was really hurt.[E] 
[N:Gabriel]Thanks for looking out for me. People mentioned it in the past, but there have been times when I’ve been worried. I just like meeting new guys is all. Maybe I’ll look around for another job. Dating is pretty fun though.[E]
[N:Gabriel]Yeah, is there something wrong? I never really tended to like male angels but ever since around half a year ago I felt a change in myself. As a matter of fact, that was around the time my wings changed too.[E]
Sometimes people get upset. They’re looking for…more from me. When I turn them down then some get furious. It gets dangerous out there and I usually just have only myself to rely on.[R:gabriel1-1-2]
Yeah. But most of the time it’s great! I get to meet new people and we go out to dinner and have a wonderful time. Plenty of them end up being some of my close friends, too! I try not to let a few bad apples ruin my day. Thanks for listening to me, Inquisitor. I’m glad to see that even someone here still cares.[E]
I don’t do it for the business! I just want to meet people and show that it’s okay to be yourself out there. Is that so much of a problem? Now more than ever we need to be ourselves![E]
Well occasionally I tend to work on 4th and Main. A lot of people tend to be more lively once they leave the speakeasy. Sometimes it’s nicer to have a couple shots of liquid courage when I work.[E]
I don’t know! Stop yelling please.[R:gabriel1-1-3]
*He remains silent, looking at his hands*[E]
There are some conflicts, yeah. They get mad and upset, but I just try to get away and things end up okay.[E]
I don’t know what crime you’re talking about but sometimes I…sleep with my clients and they give me money. Can you really help me? I don’t mean to do the things I did and I’ll get better, I promise.[E]
Crimes? I don’t know what you mean? Are you talking about the black wings? I’ve had them for a while now, but I didn’t know what they were or why it started.[R:gabriel1-2-0]
Um alright, thanks for letting me know. Sometimes I jaywalk? If I’m trying to go somewhere faster?[R:gabriel1-2-1]
But it's jaywalking! Everyone does it! You can't seriously think of punishing me for that![E]
Nowhere important! The store? Back home if it's raining.[E]
Sorry, Inquisitor. I really wanna help, but nothing is coming to mind. Sorry to make your job harder on you.[E]
Probably around half a year now.[R:gabriel1-2-2]
Nothing I can think of. Oh! That was around the time when my tastes changed. Before I used to be only interested in women, but things seemed to change. I grew attached to my fellow man. Is that wrong? Am I okay?[E]
The fall? Oh please sir, don't do it! I didn't do anything wrong! You can't do this![E]
What? What murder case? I swear I didn't do it! I must have been framed. Please don't think I did anything bad like that![E]
[N:Gabriel]*sigh* Well I suppose you could call it a job. I end up giving company to men. There are plenty out there that are confused so I try to help them relax and try out intimacy with another man.[R:gabriel1-2-3]

[N:Gabriel]My-a boss is-a always giving-a me a hard time. [P:0.5] Always yelling at Giuseppe. [P:0.5] I thought... I thought I could-a make-a him go away. [P:0.5][E]
[N:Gabriel]I-a stole the keys from the boss-a room-a. [P:0.5] That-a way everybody think it-a him who-a did it. [P:0.5][E]
[N:Gabriel]I-a broke into the-a worm store. [P:0.5] My-a cousin Lorenzo works-a there you see. [P:0.5] It-a was all-a too easy to-a grab his-a keys and walk in after-a closing time. [P:0.5][E]
[N:Gabriel]Like I-a said. [P:0.5] Giuseppe was-a in bed with-a my wife! [P:0.5] Giuseppe sleep-a at 9pm every night before work! [P:0.5][R:gabriel1-3-0]
[N:Gabriel]Uh... ah... Marg...a. [P:0.5] Marga. [P:0.5] My-a wife's name is Marga. [P:0.5][R:gabriel1-3-1]
[N:Gabriel]I'm-a sure I'm-a sure! [P:0.5] My-a lovely Marga. [P:0.5] My-a wife! [P:0.5] She is-a real! [P:0.5] I was-a with her last night! [P:0.5] Just-a like every night. [P:0.5][E]
[N:Gabriel]What? [P:0.5] A-no, she knows-a nothing- Oh... very-a clever Mr. [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5][E]
[N:Gabriel]You-a inquisitors never-a listen! [P:0.5] I never-a did that! [P:0.5] Giuseppe has-a great respect for the spaghetti factorium! [P:0.5][E]
I-a work at-a the spaghetti factorium. [P:0.5] But-a I would-a never do this! [P:0.5][R:gabriel1-3-2]
OW! [P:0.5] Mama mia what-a was that? [P:0.5] Inquisitor bru-a-tality. [P:0.5] This is-a exactly why I switched out those spaghetti noodles for the worms! [P:0.5] Those on-a top think-a that-a they can treat us-a regulars like-a dirt! [P:0.5][E]
What? [P:0.5] Ah... ah no, no. [P:0.5] Giuseppe misspoke. [P:0.5] I don't-a work at-a no spaghetti factorium. [P:0.5] I... ah... Giuseppe has no job. [P:0.5][E]
What? [P:0.5] Oh, uh, I care so-a much about... Ugh I cannot even pretend. [P:0.5] I hate that-a stupid factory. [P:0.5] Just send me away. [P:0.5][E]
You saw Giuseppe? [P:0.5] No, no it can't-a be. [P:0.5] It- it must have been someone-a else! [P:0.5][R:gabriel1-3-3]
You inquisitors are all the same. [P:0.5] You don't give-a Giuseppe a chance. [P:0.5][E]
AAAAAAHHHH NO NO-A PLEASE!!!! I HAVE A WIFE PLEASE! [P:0.5][E]
Um, ah. [P:0.5] Ok, it was me. [P:0.5] I-a did it. [P:0.5][E]
