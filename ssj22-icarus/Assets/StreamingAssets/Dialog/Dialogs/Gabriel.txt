[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Um, excuse me? [P:0.5] I was asked to come here. Is there some sort of problem? [P:0.5] I would love to help if I can, but I don’t know if there’s too much I can do. [P:0.5] I was about to get set up with a client before they guided me here.[R:gabriel1-0-0]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Well yeah. [P:0.5] I often get together with people and go out for dinner and chat with them. [P:0.5] They’re usually always civil.[R:gabriel1-1-0]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Well sometimes we do… [P:0.5] more. [P:0.5] But only with the people I really like! And sometimes it’s for free if I really like them. [P:0.5] More than anything they just give me money to help me out with bills. [P:0.5] The last one, [P:0.5] for instance, said that he just wanted to see me happy and wouldn’t take no for an answer![R:gabriel1-1-1]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Prostitution? [P:0.5] But I was just hanging out with friends! Please be reasonable, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] We weren’t doing anything wrong and no one was really hurt.[E] 
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Thanks for looking out for me. [P:0.5] People mentioned it in the past, [P:0.5] but there have been times when I’ve been worried. [P:0.5] I just like meeting new guys is all. Maybe I’ll look around for another job. [P:0.5] Dating is pretty fun though.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Yeah, [P:0.5] is there something wrong? [P:0.5] I never really tended to like male angels but ever since around half a year ago I felt a change in myself. [P:0.5] As a matter of fact, [P:0.5] that was around the time my wings changed too.[E]
Sometimes people get upset. [P:0.5] They’re looking for… [P:0.5] more from me. [P:0.5] When I turn them down then some get furious. [P:0.5] It gets dangerous out there and I usually just have only myself to rely on.[R:gabriel1-1-2]
Yeah. [P:0.5] But most of the time it’s great! [P:0.5] I get to meet new people and we go out to dinner and have a wonderful time. [P:0.5] Plenty of them end up being some of my close friends, too! I try not to let a few bad apples ruin my day. [P:0.5] Thanks for listening to me, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] I’m glad to see that even someone here still cares.[E]
I don’t do it for the business! [P:0.5] I just want to meet people and show that it’s okay to be yourself out there. [P:0.5] Is that so much of a problem? [P:0.5] Now more than ever we need to be ourselves![E]
Well occasionally I tend to work on 4th and Main. [P:0.5] A lot of people tend to be more lively once they leave the speakeasy. Sometimes it’s nicer to have a couple shots of liquid courage when I work.[E]
I don’t know! Stop yelling please.[R:gabriel1-1-3]
*He remains silent, looking at his hands*[E]
There are some conflicts, [P:0.5] yeah. [P:0.5] They get mad and upset, but I just try to get away and things end up okay.[E]
I don’t know what crime you’re talking about but sometimes I… [P:0.5] sleep with my clients and they give me money. [P:0.5] Can you really help me? I don’t mean to do the things I did and I’ll get better, [P:0.5] I promise.[E]
Crimes? I don’t know what you mean? Are you talking about the black wings? [P:0.5] I’ve had them for a while now, but I didn’t know what they were or why it started.[R:gabriel1-2-0]
Um alright, [P:0.5] thanks for letting me know. Sometimes I jaywalk? [P:0.5] If I’m trying to go somewhere faster?[R:gabriel1-2-1]
But it's jaywalking! [P:0.5] Everyone does it! [P:0.5] You can't seriously think of punishing me for that![E]
Nowhere important! [P:0.5] The store? Back home if it's raining.[E]
Sorry, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] I really wanna help, [P:0.5] but nothing is coming to mind. [P:0.5] Sorry to make your job harder on you.[E]
Probably around half a year now.[R:gabriel1-2-2]
Nothing I can think of. [P:0.5] Oh! That was around the time when my tastes changed. [P:0.5] Before I used to be only interested in women, but things seemed to change. I grew attached to my fellow man. [P:0.5] Is that wrong? Am I okay?[E]
The fall? [P:0.5] Oh please sir, don't do it! [P:0.5] I didn't do anything wrong! You can't do this![E]
What? What murder case? [P:0.5] I swear I didn't do it! I must have been framed. [P:0.5] Please don't think I did anything bad like that![E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]*sigh* [P:0.5] Well I suppose you could call it a job. I end up giving company to men. [P:0.5] There are plenty out there that are confused so I try to help them relax and try out intimacy with another man.[R:gabriel1-2-3]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Really, I don't see the problem. [P:0.5] We're all just trying to make ends meet, find meaning. Maybe God's will is wrong.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]I suppose that does step out of line, huh? [P:0.5] Providing care for one another in this dark city? [P:0.5] I just don't really believe in that sort of line these days. Do you?[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Sorry? [P:0.5] I don't suppose you'll let me go, then? See you around, [P:0.5] Inquisitor.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]You're scaring me, Inquisitor! [P:0.5] Please calm down, and I swear I'll tell you! I don't particularly like ruffians. [P:0.5] Violence doesn't suit you...[R:gabriel1-3-0]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Well... [P:0.5] if you promise. [P:0.5] I give men my companionship. [P:0.5] Sometimes it's just a dinner friend. Sometimes it's a little more. [P:0.5] The work is fulfilling, as long as the clientelle are kind. [P:0.5] *He stares at you intently*.[R:gabriel1-3-1]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]It's hard not to in this line of work. [P:0.5] I'll get all kinds of clients, from Newspaper CEO's to the common Joe. No one sticks out in particular, [P:0.5] but we usually become friends.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Sorry Inquisitor, [P:0.5] I don't really feel comfortable talking to you. [P:0.5] *He trails off*.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]*Tears begin welling up in his eyes*. I just don't understand...[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]I-I'm a male companion.[R:gabriel1-3-2]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]Well, [P:0.5] sometimes I give them conversation... [P:0.5] Sometimes they ask for a bit more.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]What way of life isn't rough, Inquisitor? [P:0.5] This city isn't what it used to be.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]I understand that's how it's written. But not why. [P:0.5] I have lots of questions like that these days.[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]*Gabriel doesn't fight back*[R:gabriel1-3-3]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]...[E]
[N:Gabriel Sullivan]...[E]
