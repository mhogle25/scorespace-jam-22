[N:Barabbas]Now hello there. [P:0.5] My name is Barabbas Sutton, [P:0.5] owner of Ecclesiarch Foods. [P:0.5] Is something the matter? [P:0.5] If there's any way I can help just let me know. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-0-0]
Not that I can think of, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5] I mean there are occasionally workers that are discontent, [P:0.5] but I pride myself in creating a good workplace. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-1-0]
There are some, [P:0.5] yes. [P:0.5] I would say there are the folks at Divinity Farms that don't like Ecclesiarch foods, [P:0.5] but that's just friendly competition. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-1-1]
Yes, [P:0.5] friendly competition. [P:0.5] And I'm right! [P:0.5] He owns a major set of farms, [P:0.5] as do I. [P:0.5] There is tension of course, [P:0.5] but we keep it strictly professional. [P:0.5] Now is that all, [P:0.5] Inquisitor? [P:0.5][E]
I have on occasion. [P:0.5] Sometimes for business meetings or if we were considering a move that would greatly affect the market. [P:0.5] I'll have you know he was a good friend. [P:0.5][E]
Some, [P:0.5] I believe. [P:0.5] Some had family that work over there, [P:0.5] brothers and sisters. [P:0.5] Others knew friends that used to work there before coming to work for me. [P:0.5][E]
Look I have no clue why these black wings are important or what they mean. [P:0.5] In fact, [P:0.5] I think you are the one that should be telling it to me. [P:0.5] I will not deal with this baseless slander. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-1-2]
And what are you going to do to get me to confess to this hypothetical crime? [P:0.5] Your hands are tied, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5] I hope they drop you through this same hatch, [P:0.5] you weasel. [P:0.5][E]
And I am telling you that I have no idea what you are talking about. [P:0.5] If I have the chance to save lives, [P:0.5] I would. [P:0.5] I always aspired to do that since I was a kid. [P:0.5] Listen, [P:0.5] don't pull the hatch. [P:0.5] Please? [P:0.5][E]
You won't let me go. [P:0.5] The truth is written along your face. [P:0.5] I know what happens here. [P:0.5] You'll have flung an innocent man to his death. [P:0.5] Let that sink in as you doom more people for your paycheck. [P:0.5][E]
Please do! [P:0.5] I have no secrets to hide and all my accounts are squared away. [P:0.5] My business is upstanding and my skills are there. [P:0.5] Do not question my ability as a business leader. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-1-3]
And an Inquisitor is supposed to do the same, [P:0.5] but you proved your incompetence today. [P:0.5] Let's be honest for once. [P:0.5] You were never on our side. [P:0.5][E]
And those records will tell you nothing. [P:0.5] I hope you enjoy your paperwork. [P:0.5][E]
I have done more for this business than you can imagine, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5] What have you sacrificed for your job? [P:0.5] Nothing! [P:0.5] Power was given to you on a silver platter. [P:0.5] Some of us had to seize it ourselves. [P:0.5][E]
Look, [P:0.5] I am sorry. [P:0.5] Every now and then I have a little drink. [P:0.5] After a long day I just want some time to unwind. [P:0.5] I never do anything bad and I only drink when I know I won't be doing any more work. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-2-0]
I know my employees smuggle some and I have some from there. [P:0.5] I don't know where they get it from. [P:0.5] As for how much? [P:0.5] Not much at all. [P:0.5] I just have a sip once every one or two months. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-2-1]
And what if I do report it? [P:0.5] The Inquisition would have rounded them up eventually. [P:0.5] In the meantime, [P:0.5] Ihave to suffer a loss in productivity without government assistance. [P:0.5] For me, [P:0.5] there was no right outcome. [P:0.5][E]
Ah you're a clever one, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5] Sadly, [P:0.5] I think you're all out of questions. [P:0.5] I guess I have to carry the truth to my grave. [P:0.5][E]
An interesting theory, [P:0.5] but sadly a wrong one. [P:0.5] I have no need to abuse any workers. [P:0.5] Why should someone damage their golden goose? [P:0.5] They make me money and I am happy to receive. [P:0.5][E]
And I'm telling you the truth! [P:0.5] Well, [P:0.5] it is true that I rarely find the time to relax nowadays, [P:0.5] but I have to remain sharp in the workplace. [P:0.5] Just like you, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-2-2]
Take it for what you will. [P:0.5] I am simply mentioning that you should be more vigilant. [P:0.5] That, [P:0.5] and that you shouldn't drink alcohol. [P:0.5] That is, [P:0.5] if you don't want to end up like me. [P:0.5] Clearly even a sip is to die for. [P:0.5][E]
And what has the Lord done? [P:0.5] Make rules and laws that hold us back. [P:0.5] Not once has he been curious? [P:0.5] Not once has he thought to do something sinful? [P:0.5] How all-knowing can he be if he has never considered impurity? [P:0.5][E]
Nothing. [P:0.5] That is what I have been trying to say. [P:0.5] I did nothing wrong, [P:0.5] and now I get punished. [P:0.5] I can't believe you go along with it. [P:0.5] A good Angel always follows orders though, [P:0.5] right? [P:0.5][E]
I go to the speakeasy sometimes, [P:0.5] but it's always alone. [P:0.5] I feel quite guilty with it all and I do not want to spread nasty habits to my employees. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-2-3]
Well you are an Inquisitor. [P:0.5] It's my duty as a citizen to tell you and support the law. [P:0.5] I would be ashamed if anyone else asked me, [P:0.5] but I know better with an agent of God. [P:0.5][E]
What can I say? [P:0.5] I'm a man of higher taste *he shrugs* implausible maybe, [P:0.5] but true. [P:0.5] I tend to like the ambiance. [P:0.5][E]
Now no need to get upset. [P:0.5] I truly am sorry if you think I committed some crime, [P:0.5] but I guarantee this is a misunderstanding. [P:0.5][E]
What the fuck is your problem, [P:0.5] you unhinged Inquisitor? [P:0.5] What? [P:0.5] You want money? [P:0.5] You don't like my success, [P:0.5] do you? [P:0.5] Fine, [P:0.5] take some money. [P:0.5] It's yours! [P:0.5] Just calm down. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-3-0]
Alright, [P:0.5] fine. [P:0.5] Thanks for being nicer. [P:0.5] I shoplifted in the past. [P:0.5] Small things: pens, [P:0.5] papers. [P:0.5] I can't help it.[P:0.5] I feel terrible about it but I see it and feel like I have to take it. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-3-1]
Of course not, [P:0.5] no! [P:0.5] I try to control the urges when I can, [P:0.5] but if it's easy and available then I just feel the need to slip it away. [P:0.5] Please don't hold it against me. [P:0.5][E]
I don't need them. [P:0.5] I see it lying in the open and my hand almost reaches out on its own. [P:0.5] I steal for the sake of stealing, [P:0.5] not for the value of the item itself. [P:0.5][E]
Positive. [P:0.5] That is why I decided not to report it. [P:0.5] I felt that something was wrong and that I should not be blamed for it. [P:0.5] I just can't control myself. [P:0.5][E]
You stupid, [P:0.5] ignorant fuck. [P:0.5] I would love nothing more than to see you crushed underneath my heel. [P:0.5] You will never understand the joy of being strong enough to watch another angel's life fade by your own hands. [P:0.5][R:barabbas1-3-2]
I guess in some ways it is. [P:0.5] Good job. [P:0.5] If I could, [P:0.5] I'd love to experience more. [P:0.5] Maybe your warm blood on my hands. [P:0.5] You're missing out, [P:0.5] Inquisitor. [P:0.5] God would never let you. [P:0.5][E]
Believe me, I did.[P:0.5] I knew if Jadon was gone that I could easily get the land.[P:0.5] I loved every second. [P:0.5][S:2] 15 stab wounds. [P:0.5] Gouged out eyes. [P:0.5][S:-1] A life up here in paradise makes you want what you could never have. [P:0.5][E]
*He lies on the ground, [P:0.5] barely breathing and unresponsive* [E]
