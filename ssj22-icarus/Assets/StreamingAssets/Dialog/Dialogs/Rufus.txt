[V:medium-high][N:?]Ohhhh hey friend,[P:0.5] remember me?[P:0.5] Where's Ishmael Jones?[P:0.5] He came in yesterday but didn't come out.[P:0.5] We had a great time at that restaurant.[P:0.5] Hiding him behind that big desk,[P:0.5] are ya?[P:0.5][R:rufus1-0-0]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Rufus Rodgers at your service,[P:0.5] proud worker at the Halo Factorium and Liberator of free restaurant goods![P:0.5] *He salutes you*[R:rufus1-1-0]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]The majestic Hos'-Pital.[P:0.5] The finest eatery in all of Daedalus.[P:0.5] You must come with me,[P:0.5] friend.[P:0.5] The ambiance of the sick and dying was enchanting *BURP*,[P:0.5] The sounds of sirens and wails were hauntingly beautiful.[P:0.5] A truly unique dining  experience![P:0.5] Also very white.[R:rufus1-1-1]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Well we came at night but no one would show up when we banged on the doors.[P:0.5] So my friend and I picked up some rocks and threw it at the door and let ourselves in![P:0.5] We were just so upset that they were keeping us back from such a nice place![E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Oh not at all![P:0.5] There were these few bouncers,[P:0.5] but they only showed up after we got our fill of the food so we just walked out the way we came.[E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Ouch![P:0.5] Yeah,[P:0.5] from Hos'-Pital weren't you listening to what I said?[P:0.5] You're just like those bouncers that got upset.[E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Keep up with work?[P:0.5] Bah I can't be bothered![P:0.5] Boss makes a dollar and I make a dime,[P:0.5] so I take breaks on company time![P:0.5] Boss is alright I guess,[P:0.5] but if you ask me he's just like those Inquisition fellas: a prude.[R:rufus1-1-2]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Helps everyone?[P:0.5] Well why don't I let me help me for a change?[P:0.5] I break my back working and what do I get?[P:0.5] Lousy pay.[P:0.5] Why don't people start helping me when I need it?[P:0.5][E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Of course he has![P:0.5] Stupid pig can't do anything himself![P:0.5] All he does is complain about how little we're working.[P:0.5] He barely works himself,[P:0.5] you know![E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Don't get me started on the Inquisition![P:0.5] Prudes and pigs,[P:0.5] all of them![P:0.5] Their whole job is to grab people off the streets and stop them from having any bit of fun in their life.[P:0.5] Who gave them the right,[P:0.5] huh?[P:0.5][E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Victoriae,[P:0.5] my friend![P:0.5] Anyway it was a good time talking to you and catching up.[P:0.5] I'm gonna head out now.[P:0.5] *He attempts to open the door* Hey why's this thing locked?[P:0.5][R:rufus1-1-3]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]I guess so,[P:0.5] but true heroes have to keep on fighting for another day.[P:0.5] Doesn't mean he has to go back to work though,[P:0.5] haha![E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]What?[P:0.5] What's going on?[P:0.5] Is that a halo?[P:0.5] Fuck,[P:0.5] you Inquisition?[P:0.5][E]
[N:Rufus Rodgers]Your job?[P:0.5] What job is that?[P:0.5] Keeping doors locked?[P:0.5] Let me out of here![E]
[N:?]The restaurant last night?[P:0.5] Weren't you there?[P:0.5] Ah,[P:0.5] whatever.[P:0.5] The majestic Hos'-Pital,[P:0.5] the shining red cross of Daedalus.[P:0.5] The wails down the halls and the *burp* sterile white tiles.[P:0.5] Yeah,[P:0.5] it was great.[R:rufus1-2-0]
[N:?]I go to the Devil's Nipple on Fourth and Main.[P:0.5] Fun place![P:0.5] Bartender keeps giving me looks though.[P:0.5] Something about a ‘tab' but he always blows hot air.[R:rufus1-2-1]
[N:?]I think it might be pretty high,[P:0.5] but it's fine.[P:0.5] I'm sure you can tell,[P:0.5] but I'm a real charming guy so I always get out of it.[E]
[N:?]Yeah he keeps saying things like: ‘Here comes Rufus again.[P:0.5] I hope he doesn't vomit on everything like last Tuesday.[P:0.5]' You know.[P:0.5] Regular banter.[E]
[N:?]I thought we were friends man?[P:0.5] Why you gotta keep judging me all the time.[P:0.5] You know what?[P:0.5] I'm leaving.[E]
[N:?]Well you know Ishmael Jones already.[P:0.5] As for everyone else we got uh [P:0.5] Josiah Owens and Vashti Mendez I think.[P:0.5] I'll show you them sometime![P:0.5] Anyway[P:0.5] is Ishmael here?[P:0.5] He didn't come back and I'm starting to get worried.[R:rufus1-2-2]
[N:?]I'm sorry![P:0.5] I didn't mean anything by it.[P:0.5] It was a fun time and I was drunk and you can't blame someone for that right?[P:0.5] Just stop screaming and let me out of here,[P:0.5] please![E]
[N:?]Uh I don't know they sometimes go to the Devil's Nipple on Fourth and Main.[P:0.5] Other times they're just working at the factory.[P:0.5] Look this office is kinda stuffy.[P:0.5] Can I get out?[P:0.5][E]
[N:?]Well if you say he's fine.[P:0.5] You're a real upstanding guy,[P:0.5] you know that?[P:0.5] I'm glad we're friends.[P:0.5] We were drunk and I don't think you'd know this about me but sometimes we do stupid things when we're drunk.[P:0.5] We just wanted a good time was all.[P:0.5] Hungry after a good drink that's it.[E]
[N:?]Oh they were wails of joy![P:0.5] They were so happy we were able to liven up the place![P:0.5] They kept moaning and groaning and going on about ‘it hurts' and ‘you're making too much of a racket' but I could tell they liked it.[P:0.5] Sometimes I think I'm a bit of a psychic that way.[R:rufus1-2-3]
[N:?]Oh thanks![P:0.5] Now what does that mean?[P:0.5] Lots of money in my future?[P:0.5] Haha[E]
[N:?]Well agree to disagree then,[P:0.5] right friend?[P:0.5] What am I saying?[P:0.5] You weren't there so how would you know?[P:0.5][E]
[N:?]What happens after you drink?[P:0.5] You get hungry![P:0.5] Or well,[P:0.5] that's the case with me anyway.[P:0.5] And there we were walking down the street and we see this huge place that looks like it's bound to have food.[P:0.5] So of course we went in![E]
[N:?]Ohhh,[P:0.5] what was he sayin'?[P:0.5] Hmmm… You ain't one of those Inquisition fellas,[P:0.5] are ya'?[P:0.5] Hate those guys.[R:rufus1-3-0]
[N:?]You don't know?[P:0.5] Ah well,[P:0.5] they're the police,[P:0.5] right?[P:0.5] The pigs will round up Fallen angels.[R:rufus1-3-1]
[N:?]They're on my back?[P:0.5] You think that's easy to see?[P:0.5] Let me go- *he turns his head to look at his back* Ah shit.[E]
[N:?]Oh well it was nice talking to you![P:0.5] I think I'll head home now.[P:0.5] Maybe get a drink or two.[P:0.5] The day's still young![E]
[N:?]Sorry about what?[P:0.5] You know you've been acting pretty strange this whole time.[P:0.5] You okay,[P:0.5] bud?[P:0.5][E]
[N:?]Oh… I haven't done *BURP* anything wrong![P:0.5] Where's Ishmael?[P:0.5] Is he back there?[P:0.5] Please,[P:0.5] I'll give you some free food I got earlier.[R:rufus1-3-2]
[N:?]C'mon,[P:0.5] pal.[P:0.5] I ain't done nothing wrong.[P:0.5] Just got drunk and lifted some free food from a restaurant with free food.[E]
[N:?]Wait,[P:0.5] please![P:0.5] I-I got it at sum' fancy free food place.[P:0.5] Called Hos'-Pital?[P:0.5] I didn't pay too much attention.[P:0.5] Wuz getting chased about by the staff.[E]

[N:?]Hahaha,[P:0.5] glad yur' on my side,[P:0.5] buddy.[P:0.5] Meet me at the Devil's Nipple for a drink sometime.[P:0.5] We got more friends everywhere.[R:rufus1-3-3]
[N:?]Ah,[P:0.5] I don't know,[P:0.5] some kind of restaurant with free food?[P:0.5] Ver' white tile.[P:0.5] Smelled like chemicals.[E]
