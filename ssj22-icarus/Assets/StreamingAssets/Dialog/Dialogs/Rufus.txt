[N:?]Ohhhh hey friend, remember me? Where's Ishmael Jones? He came in yesterday but didn't come out. We had a great time at that restaurant. Hiding him behind that big desk, are ya?[R:rufus1-0-0]
[N:Rufus]Rufus Rodgers at your service, proud worker at the Halo Factorium and Liberator of free restaurant goods! *He salutes you*[R:rufus1-1-0]
[N:Rufus]The majestic Hos'-Pítal. The finest eatery in all of Daedalus. You must come with me, friend. The ambiance of the sick and dying was enchanting *BURP*, The sounds of sirens and wails were hauntingly beautiful. A truly unique dining  experience! Also very white.[R:rufus1-1-1]
[N:Rufus]Well we came at night but no one would show up when we banged on the doors. So my friend and I picked up some rocks and threw it at the door and let ourselves in! We were just so upset that they were keeping us back from such a nice place![E]
[N:Rufus]Oh not at all! There were these few bouncers, but they only showed up after we got our fill of the food so we just walked out the way we came.[E]
[N:Rufus]Ouch! Yeah, from Hos'-Pítal weren't you listening to what I said? You're just like those bouncers that got upset.[E]
[N:Rufus]Keep up with work? Bah I can't be bothered! Boss makes a dollar and I make a dime, so I take breaks on company time! Boss is alright I guess, but if you ask me he's just like those Inquisition fellas: a prude.[R:rufus1-1-2]
[N:Rufus]Helps everyone? Well why don't I let me help me for a change? I break my back working and what do I get? Lousy pay. Why don't people start helping me when I need it?[E]
[N:Rufus]Of course he has! Stupid pig can't do anything himself! All he does is complain about how little we're working. He barely works himself, you know![E]
[N:Rufus]Don't get me started on the Inquisition! Prudes and pigs, all of them! Their whole job is to grab people off the streets and stop them from having any bit of fun in their life. Who gave them the right, huh?[E]
[N:Rufus]"Victoriae, my friend! Anyway it was a good time talking to you and catching up. I'm gonna head out now. *He attempts to open the door* Hey why's this thing locked?"[R:rufus1-1-3]
[N:Rufus]I guess so, but true heroes have to keep on fighting for another day. Doesn't mean he has to go back to work though, haha![E]
[N:Rufus]What? What's going on? Is that a halo? Fuck, you Inquisition?[E]
[N:Rufus]Your job? What job is that? Keeping doors locked? Let me out of here![E]
[N:?]The restaurant last night? Weren't you there? Ah, whatever. The majestic Hos'-Pítal, the shining red cross of Daedalus. The wails down the halls and the *burp* sterile white tiles. Yeah, it was great.[R:rufus1-2-0]
[N:?]I go to the Devil's Nipple on Fourth and Main. Fun place! Bartender keeps giving me looks though. Something about a ‘tab' but he always blows hot air.[R:rufus1-2-1]
[N:?]I think it might be pretty high, but it's fine. I'm sure you can tell, but I'm a real charming guy so I always get out of it.[E]
[N:?]Yeah he keeps saying things like: ‘Here comes Rufus again. I hope he doesn't vomit on everything like last Tuesday.' You know. Regular banter.[E]
[N:?]I thought we were friends man? Why you gotta keep judging me all the time. You know what? I'm leaving.[E]
[N:?]Well you know Ishmael Jones already. As for everyone else we got uh Josiah Owens and Vashti Mendez I think. I'll show you them sometime! Anyway is Ishmael here? He didn't come back and I'm starting to get worried.[R:rufus1-2-2]
[N:?]I'm sorry! I didn't mean anything by it. It was a fun time and I was drunk and you can't blame someone for that right? Just stop screaming and let me out of here, please![E]
[N:?]Uh I don't know they sometimes go to the Devil's Nipple on Fourth and Main. Other times they're just working at the factory. Look this office is kinda stuffy. Can I get out?[E]
[N:?]Well if you say he's fine. You're a real upstanding guy, you know that? I'm glad we're friends. We were drunk and I don't think you'd know this about me but sometimes we do stupid things when we're drunk. We just wanted a good time was all. Hungry after a good drink that's it.[E]
[N:?]Oh they were wails of joy! They were so happy we were able to liven up the place! They kept moaning and groaning and going on about ‘it hurts' and ‘you're making too much of a racket' but I could tell they liked it. Sometimes I think I'm a bit of a psychic that way.[R:rufus1-2-3]
[N:?]Oh thanks! Now what does that mean? Lots of money in my future? Haha[E]
[N:?]Well agree to disagree then, right friend? What am I saying? You weren't there so how would you know?[E]
[N:?]What happens after you drink? You get hungry! Or well, that's the case with me anyway. And there we were walking down the street and we see this huge place that looks like it's bound to have food. So of course we went in![E]
[N:?]Ohhh, what was he sayin'? Hmmm… You ain't one of those Inquisition fellas, are ya'? Hate those guys.[R:rufus1-3-0]
[N:?]You don't know? Ah well, they're the police, right? The pigs will round up Fallen angels.[R:rufus1-3-1]
[N:?]They're on my back? You think that's easy to see? Let me go- *he turns his head to look at his back* Ah shit.[E]
[N:?]Oh well it was nice talking to you! I think I'll head home now. Maybe get a drink or two. The day's still young![E]
[N:?]Sorry about what? You know you've been acting pretty strange this whole time. You okay, bud?[E]
[N:?]Oh… I haven't done *BURP* anything wrong! Where's Ishmael? Is he back there? Please, I'll give you some free food I got earlier.[R:rufus1-3-2]
[N:?]C'mon, pal. I ain't done nothing wrong. Just got drunk and lifted some free food from a restaurant with free food.[E]
[N:?]Wait, please! I-I got it at sum' fancy free food place. Called Hos'-Pital? I didn't pay too much attention. Wuz getting chased about by the staff.[E]
[N:?]No, there's gotta' be somethin' I could do! Wait![E]
[N:?]Hahaha, glad yur' on my side, buddy. Meet me at the Devil's Nipple for a drink sometime. We got more friends everywhere.[R:rufus1-3-3]
[N:?]Ah, I don't know, some kind of restaurant with free food? Ver' white tile. Smelled like chemicals.[E]
[N:?]I KNEW IT. Fugkck off pig.[E]
[N:?]I'm a big fan of Hallowed Halo, or Hell's Brews. Lots of good shidd out there.[E]
