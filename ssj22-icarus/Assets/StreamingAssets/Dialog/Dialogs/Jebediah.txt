[N:Jebediah]You're a goddamn menace, Inquisitor! [P:0.5] You can't hold me like this. [P:0.5] Anything that happens to me will be published in tomorrow's issue of the Congregation! [P:0.5] You'll be all over the news![R:jebediah1-0-0]
[N:Jebediah]I'll tell you what I was doing, I was uprooting a MENACE. [P:0.5] I bring truth to the peoples' ears one way or another.[R:jebediah1-1-0]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah we all know what ‘being out of here' means, a-hole. [P:0.5] I've heard the rumors. [P:0.5] I've got ears to the ground.[R:jebediah1-1-1]
[N:Jebediah]And why the fuck would I do that, Quizzy. [P:0.5] Let me outta' here.[E]
[N:Jebediah]You're a morbid piece of work, huh Quizzy? [P:0.5] Yeah I got some speakeasies. [P:0.5] Maybe a couple volunteer interns… Fuck. [P:0.5] Let the kids off easy, huh?[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah. [P:0.5] Sure, kid.[E]
[N:Jebediah]The kind where you mind your own damned business. [P:0.5] Not everyone likes being torn by prying eyes, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] Some people like a bit of privacy.[R:jebediah1-1-2]
[N:Jebediah]I just like to sit back and unwind a bit. [P:0.5] Nothing special. [P:0.5] Just me and myself with a cold beverage.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Cya' never, kid.[E]
[N:Jebediah]If anything… [P:0.5] I've got some interns. [P:0.5] Of the volunteer variety. [P:0.5] They're good kids, mostly. [P:0.5] Leave ‘em alone. [P:0.5] Except Barry, fuck that guy.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Aww c'mon, Quizzy. [P:0.5] Everyone's got some dirt, right?[R:jebediah1-1-3]
[N:Jebediah]Well… [P:0.5] let's just say I have some extra-curricular businesses. [P:0.5] Now let me fuck off in peace.[E]
[N:Jebediah]And you're a pig.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Guess you'll just have to see, huh Quizzy. [P:0.5] Let me out.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Cunt *spits*.[R:jebediah1-2-0]
[N:Jebediah]Fucking, cunt *spits*.[R:jebediah1-2-1]
[N:Jebediah]Shit, fucking, cunt *spits*.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Fuck you, kid. [P:0.5] I own speakeasies. [P:0.5] Whatever. [P:0.5] Now let me out.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Whatever.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah, I brewed it special just for you, Quizzy.[R:jebediah1-2-2]
[N:Jebediah]I ain't that fucked. [P:0.5] You don't know shit.[E]
[N:Jebediah]I'm actually sober. [P:0.5] Look at my complexion, pig.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah maybe a bit, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] What can ya' do…[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah, you've overstepped, Inquisitor. [P:0.5] I ain't helping with shit.[R:jebediah1-2-3]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah, yeah. Alright. [P:0.5] I've got a speakeasy downtown. [P:0.5] But I ain't telling you who I'm working with.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Shut up, Quizzy.[E]
[N:Jebediah]And this is my last stop, [P:0.5] cunt.[E]
[N:Jebediah]We've got innocent, unpaid interns! [P:0.5] You wouldn't harm a hair on their body, no matter what I'd done![R:jebediah1-3-0]
[N:Jebediah]You're a real piece of work, [P:0.5] you know that… [P:0.5] [S:0.2] I own speakeasies. [P:0.5] Three of ‘em. Got a couple downtown and one in the boonies. [S:-1] [P:0.5] Feathers sprouted almost the moment I signed the papers. [P:0.5] Was… [P:0.5] a few weeks ago?[R:jebediah1-3-1]
[N:Jebediah]Jebediah remains silent[E]
[N:Jebediah]A couple'a interns I pulled from the Congregation. [P:0.5] They're nobodies with no money; [P:0.5] leave ‘em alone.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Fuck you.[E]
[N:Jebediah]And who doesn't?! [P:0.5] What, you think the Big Man built this all himself, emptyin' his deep, fuckin pockets? [P:0.5] These kids are gettin' college credit at least. [P:0.5] More than I ever got! [P:0.5] Maybe by the end of it, they'll own more businesses than I do.[R:jebediah1-3-2]
[N:Jebediah]...Nowadays, [P:0.5] all I've got is the Congregation. [P:0.5] Why do you ask?[E]
[N:Jebediah]Well uhh- [P:0.5] fuck off, Quizzy. Goddammit. [P:0.5] Yeah, okay. [P:0.5] I've got some interns and we don't compensate them with what you might call ‘normal' currency.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah, [P:0.5] I'm sure you do, Quizzy. [P:0.5] I ain't tellin' you anything.[E]
[N:Jebediah]You can't hit for shit, inquisitor.[R:jebediah1-3-3]
[N:Jebediah]Wow, [P:0.5] great stuff Quizzy. [P:0.5] I'm real fuckin' intimidated by those glizzies you call arms.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Only one more stubborn is my sister. Learned it from her, the crazy broad! [P:0.5] Love her.[E]
[N:Jebediah]You hit worse than my lazy fuckin intern.[E]
