[N:?]You’re a goddamn menace, Inquisitor! [P:0.5] You can’t hold me like this. [P:0.5] Anything that happens to me will be published in tomorrow’s issue of the Congregation! [P:0.5] You’ll be all over the news![R:Jebediah1-0-0]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah we all know what ‘being out of here’ means, a-hole. I’ve heard the rumors. I’ve got ears to the ground.[R:Jebediah1-1-0]
[N:Jebediah]The kind where you mind your own damned business. Not everyone likes being torn by prying eyes, Inquisitor. Some people like a bit of privacy.[R:Jebediah1-1-1]
[N:Jebediah]And why the fuck would I do that, Quizzy. Let me outta’ here.[E]
[N:Jebediah]You’re a morbid piece of work, huh Quizzy? Yeah I got some speakeasies. Maybe a couple volunteer interns… Fuck. Let the kids off easy, huh?[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah. Sure, kid.[E]
[N:Jebediah]The kind where you mind your own damned business. Not everyone likes being torn by prying eyes, Inquisitor. Some people like a bit of privacy.[R:Jebediah1-1-2]
[N:Jebediah]I just like to sit back and unwind a bit. Nothing special. Just me and myself with a cold beverage.[E]
[N:Jebediah]FINISH ME[E]
[N:Jebediah]If anything… I’ve got some interns. Of the volunteer variety. They’re good kids, mostly. Leave ‘em alone. Except Barry, fuck that guy.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Aww c’mon, Quizzy. Everyone’s got some dirt, right?[R:Jebediah1-1-3]
[N:Jebediah]Well… let’s just say I have some extra-curricular businesses. Now let me fuck off in peace.[E]
[N:Jebediah]And you’re a pig.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Guess you’ll just have to see, huh Quizzy. Let me out.[E]
