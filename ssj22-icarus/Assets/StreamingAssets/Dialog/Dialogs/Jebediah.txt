[N:?]You're a goddamn menace, Inquisitor! [P:0.5] You can't hold me like this. [P:0.5] Anything that happens to me will be published in tomorrow's issue of the Congregation! [P:0.5] You'll be all over the news![R:Jebediah1-0-0]
[N:Jebediah]I'll tell you what I was doing, I was uprooting a MENACE. I bring truth to the peoples' ears one way or another.[R:Jebediah1-1-0]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah we all know what ‘being out of here' means, a-hole. I've heard the rumors. I've got ears to the ground.[R:Jebediah1-1-1]
[N:Jebediah]And why the fuck would I do that, Quizzy. Let me outta' here.[E]
[N:Jebediah]You're a morbid piece of work, huh Quizzy? Yeah I got some speakeasies. Maybe a couple volunteer interns… Fuck. Let the kids off easy, huh?[E]
[N:Jebediah]Yeah. Sure, kid.[E]
[N:Jebediah]The kind where you mind your own damned business. Not everyone likes being torn by prying eyes, Inquisitor. Some people like a bit of privacy.[R:Jebediah1-1-2]
[N:Jebediah]I just like to sit back and unwind a bit. Nothing special. Just me and myself with a cold beverage.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Cya' never, kid.[E]
[N:Jebediah]If anything… I've got some interns. Of the volunteer variety. They're good kids, mostly. Leave ‘em alone. Except Barry, fuck that guy.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Aww c'mon, Quizzy. Everyone's got some dirt, right?[R:Jebediah1-1-3]
[N:Jebediah]Well… let's just say I have some extra-curricular businesses. Now let me fuck off in peace.[E]
[N:Jebediah]And you're a pig.[E]
[N:Jebediah]Guess you'll just have to see, huh Quizzy. Let me out.[E]
[N:?]Cunt *spits*.[R:Jebediah1-2-0]
[N:?]Fucking, cunt *spits*.[R:Jebediah1-2-1]
[N:?]Shit, fucking, cunt *spits*.[E]
[N:?]Yeah, y'know what? Hahaha, fuck you, kid. I own speakeasies. Whatever. Now let me out.[E]
[N:?]Whatever.[E]
[N:?]Yeah, I brewed it special just for you, Quizzy.[R:Jebediah1-2-2]
[N:?]I ain't that fucked. You don't know shit.[E]
[N:?]I'm actually sober. Look at my complexion, pig.[E]
[N:?]Yeah maybe a bit, Inquisitor. What can ya' do…[E]
[N:?]Yeah, you've overstepped, Inquisitor. I ain't helping with shit.[R:Jebediah1-2-3]
[N:?]Yeah, yeah. Alright. I've got a speakeasy downtown. But I ain't telling you who I'm working with.[E]
[N:?]Shut up, Quizzy.[E]
[N:?]And this is my last stop, cunt.[E]
[N:?]We've got innocent, unpaid interns! You wouldn't harm a hair on their body, no matter what I'd done![R:Jebediah1-3-0]
[N:?]You're a real piece of work, you know that… I own speakeasies. Three of ‘em. Got a couple downtown and one in the boonies. Feathers sprouted almost the moment I signed the papers. Was probably… a few weeks ago?[R:Jebediah1-3-1]
[N:?]Jebediah remains silent[E]
[N:?]A couple'a interns I pulled from the Congregation. They're nobodies with no money; leave ‘em alone.[E]
[N:?]Fuck you.[E]
[N:?]And who doesn't?! What, you think the Big Man built this all himself, emptyin' his deep, fuckin pockets? These kids are gettin' college credit at least. More than I ever got! Maybe by the end of it, they'll own more businesses than I do.[R:Jebediah1-3-2]
[N:?]...Nowadays, all I've got is the Congregation. Why do you ask?[E]
[N:?]Well uhh- fuck off, Quizzy. Goddammit. Yeah, okay. I've got some unpaid interns and we don't exactly compensate them with what you might call ‘normal' currency.[E]
[N:?]Yeah, I'm sure you do, Quizzy. I ain't tellin' you anything.[E]
[N:?]You can't hit for shit, inquisitor.[R:Jebediah1-3-3]
[N:?]Wow, great stuff Quizzy. I'm real fuckin' intimidated by those glizzies you call arms.[E]
[N:?]Only one more stubborn is my sister. Learned it from her, the crazy broad! Love her.[E]
[N:?]You hit worse than my lazy fuckin intern.[E]
